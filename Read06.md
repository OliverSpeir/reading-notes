- https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/
- https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/
- Two important topics due to their relevance in today's job market
- Node is a powerful and very popular environment

## What is node.js?
- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- meaning it is a program that executes javascript code

## In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
- An open source program written in C++ that runs javascript code inside Chrome and chromium based browers

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
- runtime or runtime environment means that it is a program that executes javascript code 

## What is npm?
- Node Package Manager, meaning it downloads installs and runs packages of javascript code

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
- 1: Greater efficiency
- 2: Engaged collabortion
- 3: Learning from fellow students
- 4: Social skills
- 5: Job interview readiness
- 6: Work environment readiness

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- Having yet to pair program I'd imagine learning from fellow students to be the biggest benefit, not to diminish the other benefits though. 

## How does pair programming work?
- Driver and Navigator 
- The Driver writes the code 
- The Navigator dictates and looks up relevant information
