# Functional Programming
- This important paradigm is the counter part of object oriented programming, and has the advantage of not affecting everything 

## What is functional programming?
- paradigm that uses pure functions 
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
## What are the benefits of a pure function?
- the fact that they do not have side effects and are easier to test
## What is immutability?
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created
## What is Referential transparency?
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
## What is a module?
- a javascript file, similar to a component in react
## What does the word ‘require’ do?
- basically imports like in react, it takes the path and then allows whatever is on the end of that path to be used as basically an extension of that code 
## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
- require it
## What do we have to do to make a module available?
- module.export the portions of code we want to be made available
