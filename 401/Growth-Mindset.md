### [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)
- Practice does not necessarily mean improvement 
- Cal Newport on the subject:
- " The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety."
- **Deliberate Practice Defined:**
- "Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance."
- **Key ideas behind deliberate practice:**
- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results in continuously available
- It's highly demanding mentally
- It's difficult
- It requires good goals
- ** Resources for Practice: **

### [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)
- 'Power of Yet'
- Never failing just having succeeded yet
- Always on a learning curve, and a path to the future
- Abilities can be developed
- 'Tyranny of Now'
- Those suffering under the tyranny of now looked to cheat and find someone who was worse than them
- Fixed Mindset students have significantly less electric activity in their brains than Growth Mindset 
- Fixed Mindset has a need for constant validation
- 'Bridge to Yet' aka creating a growth mindset
- Praise process instead of achievements
- Reward yet (effort strategy and progress) and use the word yet
- See learning as exercise, neural pathways are built by effort and difficulty

### [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
- IQ was not the only difference between best and worst performers in her 7th grade math class
- Need better motivation 
- She studied successful people in many different circumstances and found that grit was the indicator for success
- Grit is passion and perserverance for very long term goals, having stamina, sticking with your future for years and working very hard, living life like a marathon
- Grittier kids were more likely to succeed after she developed a grit questionaire and studied highschool students
- How to build grit? She doesn't know. Talent does not build grit though. Grit can be inversely related to talent. 
- She thinks that Growth Mindset can help build grit 
- Learning about the brain and how it changes when learning and struggling
- Thinks we need more than growth mindset

### [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)
- Easier to make money than it is to stay calm about our careers
- Victims of career crises: because we are surrounded by snobs, snobs are people who take small part of person and come to large conclusion
- Opposite of a snob is motherly love
- Envy is linked to spirit of equality (must relate)
- Spirit of equality is incorrect, many people have significantly different resources for their career for example
- Fear of failure is linked to lack of sympathy 
- Tragic art can somewhat heal the lack of sympathy 
- Self worship 
- Insight into success: cant be successful at everything
- Must admit that a sucess in one area is a failure in another
- Ideas of success are handed down to us or absorbed externally (media and marketing)

### [Assess your emotional intelligence](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html)
- Having Assessed my emotional intelligence in the past I will identify where I've grown recently
- I have improved my self-management skills 
- I look forward to focusing on improving my overall emotional intelligence as regardless of this score I can improve upon my Self-Awareness constantly and other areas like Social awareness and relationship management
- Continuous Improvement is key and having a Growth Mindset when applied to emotional intelligence will help me enjoy the challenge and deliberately practice

### [Assess your biases](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)
- Again I am revisting this assessment and will note my improvement and thoughts
- I have improved in courage and taking a more active approach to latent areas of myself that might be affecting my life unconsciously
- This is another area for continuous improvement, and an example where Deliberate Practice is very key.
