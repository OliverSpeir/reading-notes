- Frequency analysis 
  - human languages tend to use some letters more than others
  - can analyze frequency of characters in message and narrow down shift possibilities 
- Known plaintext
  - use some portion already unencrypted content to find the cypher

- Brute force
  - try every possible shift 

- Symmetric encryption 
  - where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data
  - Caesar Cipher / Vigenere Cipher

- Public and Private Key Encryption
  - public and private key are generated
    - public key is sent to server and encrypts data in way that can only be decrypted with private key
