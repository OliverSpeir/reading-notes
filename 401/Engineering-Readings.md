## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- My life experiences are really the only thing that can truly seperate me. Some ways I can leverage my life experiences to my advantage: Every problem I have encountered so far has had a solution. I have found that solution. I have learned how to learn, and I have learned how to solve problems. I have learned how to look forward to see potential future problems, and having spent many years considering philosophy combined with schools of thought like Lean Manufactoring and Continuous Improvement I have honed my ability to approach dynamic problems. Thinking like a programmer has been a part of my life long before I became a programmer, and I used to call it thinking like a smart lazy person. Innovation and creativity has always been a passion of mine, as I have been enchanted by the incredible things humans have done with their lives. I can bring that passion with me whereever I work and they will benefit from having me on their team.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
```
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code. 
```
- Putting this above my answer because I feel it is worth re-iterating this approach. Bearing this in mind one will still find themselves stuck at some point inevitably.
1. I will reapproach the problem, walking myself through my original plan from the beginning 
2. I will take a 15 minute break 
3. I will "get creative" and reconsider my plan, and then do broad research on the subject I am working on. Attempting to find similiar solutions, or come up with alternative solutions. (To add a 4th step without actually adding one) I will then reach out for help in anyway that I can, almost every situation has a built in support network and if it is truly a personal project I can always contact my personal network.
