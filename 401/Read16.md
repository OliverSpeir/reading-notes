## [IBM What Is Serverless?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)

- Web Development without managing servers or a backend
- Cloud based solution where idle capacity isn't paid for, resources 'scale to zero' when not in use
- serverless computing, microservices and containers = cloud native application development
- Function as a service (cloud provider makes sure the code is ready to run at any time)
- Knavtive is an extension to kubernetes adds serverless framework, and allows for containers to be developed in a way that lets them be deployed by cloud providers

- Serverless allows for containers (functions/microservicers/frontends) to be written in any language, deployed without concern for scaling and allocation of resources.

- API backends are great usecase for serverless, "API gateway" is added to the container to provide auth, rate limiting and custom domain support

- Serverless commonly supports microservice architectures (which commonly use APIs)

- Serverless is great for data processing, stream processing, etc
