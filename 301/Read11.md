## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
| sql | nosql |
| --- | --- |
| relational | non-relational or distrubted |
| table based | document based |
| pre-defined schema | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? 
- data that requires complex queries 
## Give a real world example.
- You might want to perform complex queries on things like sales data from a business, seeing sales on a certain day of the week or week of a month for example 
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- hierarchical data, following the key-value pair like a json file
## Give a real world example
- Hierarchical data is data structured in a tree. One good example is an organizational map like one where you'd see the CEO at the top and all that report to him under.
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- noSQL
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
- sql is scaled by improving CPU power nosql is scaled by adding more storage 
- nosql are easier to scale 
## What does SQL stand for?
- structured query language 
## What is a relational database?
- organizes data in predefined relationships, tables of columns and rows 
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- SQL typically 
## What is a ‘schema’?
- the way that data on the table is organized, basically column titles that every row will have some value for 
## What is a NoSQL database?
- a non relational database 
## How does it work?
- no schema, collection of "documents" of data 
## What is inside of a MongoDB database?
- documents that look like json files 
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- mongoDB because it doesn't need to fit into a schema 
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- because of lack of relation you might need to duplicate data
